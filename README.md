# Cookie Eater

A Chrome extension to remove exclusively YouTube cookies for when it fails to
load videos.


## Installation & Usage

The extension can be installed in Chrome directly from the folder. To use the extension, just click the "Cookie Eater" button.


## What Does This Do?

YouTube has a tendency to stop loading videos occasionally, so this extension
removes only the cookies YouTube has set, and refreshes the page. If you are
logged into your Google account, you will remain logged in, as those cookies
are not set on the YouTube domain.
